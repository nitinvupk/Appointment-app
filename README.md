Welcome to the Appointment App project!

This is our appointment management front-end application. It is built on an angular 9.

# About Project

On the first page, we have around 10 mockup businesses (hardcoded).

When we click on a business it redirect to page where we have a form for a new appointment with the following:

A dropdown where you could pick a certain date and a certain time (examples: 12:00, 12:30, 13:00. 13:30, etc...).

There are 4 input fields for First Name, Last Name, Phone, and email

All the fields have form validation (required, is email, minLength, etc..)
